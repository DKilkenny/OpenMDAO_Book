# Welcome to OpenMDAO

OpenMDAO is an open-source high-performance computing platform for
systems analysis and multidisciplinary optimization, written in Python.
It enables you to decompose your models, making them easier to build and
maintain, while still solving them in a tightly coupled manner with
efficient parallel numerical methods.

The OpenMDAO project is primarily focused on supporting gradient-based
optimization with analytic derivatives to allow you to explore large
design spaces with hundreds or thousands of design variables, but the
framework also has a number of parallel computing features that can
work with gradient-free optimization, mixed-integer nonlinear
programming, and traditional design space exploration.

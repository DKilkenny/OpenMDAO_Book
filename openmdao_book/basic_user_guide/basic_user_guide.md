# Basic User Guide

These tutorials serve to give an initial introduction to the OpenMDAO framework. They are intended to be read in order, and you should complete all of them to gain a basic understanding of the framework. After going through these tutorials, you will know how to define components, combine those components into larger models, and then run optimizations on those models.
